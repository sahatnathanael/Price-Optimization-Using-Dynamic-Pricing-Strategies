# Price-Optimization-Using-Dynamic-Pricing-Strategies

Price optimization is a strategic approach that uses data analysis and modelling to determine the optimal pricing of products or services. This process involves considering various factors, including market demand, competition, costs, and customer behaviour, to set prices that maximizes profitability and market share. It enables businesses to set optimal prices which involves competitive analysis to monitor market positioning, customer segemntation to identify varying willingness to pay and the use of mathematical optimization algorithms to determine the best price points. 

The dataset needed is based on sales, costs, competition, and market trends. It contains pricing information for various items sold at a retail store and their corresponding prices at competing stores. The dataset includes the following columns:
  - Fiscal_Week_Id: The fiscal week identifier.
  - Store_Id: The store identifier.
  - Price: The price of the item at our store.
  - Item_Quantity: The quantity of the item sold.
  - Sales_Amount_No_Discount: Sales amount without discount.
  - Sales_Amount: Sales amount after discounts.
  - Competition_Price: The price of the item at the competing store.

The data spans multiple fiscal weeks and includes various items across different categories, providing a comprehensive view od the pricing strategies and sales performance.

Problem Statement
In order to develop a dynamic pricing model that optimizes the prices of items to maximize revenue while remaining competitive in the market. This involves:
  = Analyzing the current pricing strategy and its impact on sales and revenue.
  - Comparing our pricing strategy with that of the competition to identify gaps and opportunities.
  - Developing a dynamic pricing model that adjusts prices based on factors such as competitor  pricing, demand elasticity, and maarket trends.
  - Implementing and simulating the dynamic pricing model to compare its performance againts the existing pricing strategy.
